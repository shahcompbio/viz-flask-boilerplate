# Distribution

This should contain all the files needed for a person to run the Flask server

This will usually consist of:
- The standalone `template.html` (after running `build_template.py`)
- A python file with the server


## How to use

Run `python server.py <dashboard_id> <name>` to start the backend.

Then you should be able to navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
